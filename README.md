# Simple-Encryption-And-Decryption-Code-For-Python
This program will encrypt any message, given a key, and decrypt other messages encrypted from it.

To use, input your key that you were given by someone else if you are decrypting a message or just make one up.
Then input if you want to decrypt or encrypt (if the other person encrypted a message with decrypt you just use encrypt).
After that put your message you want to be encoded or decoded into the console and you will have either an encrypted message or a decrypted message.
